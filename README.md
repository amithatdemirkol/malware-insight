# Malware Insight

Malware Insight is a Python-based tool designed for analyzing files to detect malicious content using various techniques, including file signature checks, YARA rule analysis, and VirusTotal API integration. This tool is aimed at cybersecurity professionals and researchers who want to perform thorough malware analysis.

## Features of the project
- Upload files for analysis via a web interface.
- Perform file signature checks against known malware signatures.
- Analyze files using YARA rules to detect malicious behavior.
- Use VirusTotal to scan files and obtain detailed reports on detected threats.
- Temporary storage of uploaded files for enhanced security.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- YARA
- Requests library

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask yara-python requests
```

## Installation
- Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-insight.git
```

- Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd malware-insight
```

- Install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Replace YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY in modules/virustotal_api.py with your actual VirusTotal API key.


## Usage

- Start the Flask application:

```bash
python main.py
```
- Open your web browser and navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.

- Upload a file you want to analyze. The tool will perform the analysis and display the results.

- Review the analysis results, including file information, YARA analysis results, and VirusTotal scan results.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how the tool works:

1. Successful Analysis:

- You upload a file named malicious_file.exe, and the tool identifies it as malicious based on its signature and YARA rules.
- The output will indicate:

```bash
File is malicious! (Signature: <SHA-256 Hash>)
YARA Analysis: Malicious behaviors detected!
VirusTotal Result: 5/60 scanners flagged this file as malicious.
```

2. Clean File Analysis:

- You upload a file named safe_file.txt, and the tool confirms that it is clean.
- The output will show:
```bash
File appears to be clean. (Signature: <SHA-256 Hash>)
YARA Analysis: No malicious behaviors detected.
VirusTotal Result: 0/60 scanners flagged this file as malicious.
```

## Contributing
If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or new features, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Report bugs or issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The performance of the YARA analysis depends on the quality and specificity of the rules provided. Regularly update your YARA rules to improve detection capabilities.


> [!NOTE]  
> Your VirusTotal API key has usage limits. Be mindful of the number of scans you perform to avoid hitting the daily limit.

> [!TIP]
> You can extend the functionality of the tool by adding your custom YARA rules in the rules/ directory. This allows you to tailor the detection capabilities to your specific needs.
